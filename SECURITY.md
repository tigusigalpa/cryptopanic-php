# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability in `cryptopanic-php`, please report it responsibly:

- Email: sovletig@gmail.com
- Do not open a public GitHub issue for security vulnerabilities.

## API Key Safety

- **Never** hardcode your CryptoPanic `auth_token` in source code.
- **Always** load tokens from environment variables or a secure secret manager.
- The SDK never logs the token, includes it in error messages, or exposes it in user-facing URLs.
- Pagination URLs returned by the SDK have the `auth_token` parameter redacted to `[REDACTED]`.
